# ROBLOX-Stud-Imprinter
A program used to easily tint ROBLOX's stud textures.

# How do you use it
When you first launch it, you have to provide an output path, but that gets saved to a file in appdata, so you won't have to do it everytime you launch the
program, unless the folder or file goes missing.

You simply enter a R, G, B, and Alpha value, then the intensity of the imprint, then boom, you got your files in the directory you specified.

You can change the path by going to the main menu and typing 'path' to go to the path change menu.
